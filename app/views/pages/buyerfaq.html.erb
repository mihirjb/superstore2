			<div class="faq panel panel-info"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"> What does it mean when a listing has been "approved and verified" by Phonesalad staff? </h4></div><div class="panel-body">

			<p>So is a listing that is surveyed and approved ensured to be genuine? The reply, shockingly, is no. Phonesalad can't ensure the intentions or future activities of any seller. At the same time we can ensure that no other site works harder to avert "fraudulent" listings and bargains. Furthermore we're really great at it.</p></div></div>

			<div class=" faq panel panel-info"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"> What happens if what I get doesn't match what I purchased? </h4></div><div class="panel-body">

	</div></div> 

			<div class= "faq panel panel-info"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"> What is a Paypal confirmed address and why is it vital? </h4></div><div class="panel-body"> 

		<p>	A Paypal Confirmed Address is an address joined to a verified record that Paypal gives an exceptional "confirmed" status to. Paypal broadens more seller assurances when offering to a buyer with a confirmed address. 
</p>



			<p>Paypal does not by and large "confirm" address outside of the US, Canada and UK. </p>

		<p>	A "confirmed address" is NOT the same as a "verified record" on Paypal. </p></div></div>

			<div class=" faq panel panel-info"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"> Can I utilize Phonesalad from Canada, Europe, India and anyplace else on the planet? </h4></div><div class="panel-body"> 

		<p>	The short answer is yes! Kindly do. At the same time there are a couple of things to remember... </p>

			<p>For a particular listing, the seller of every device listing confirms where they will send. If its not too much trouble contact the seller through the comments segment at the lowest part of the listing page to inquire as to whether they will ship to where you are (before you purchase). They may need to charge an additional transportation expense. It is dependent upon you and the seller to work together and work it out.</p> </div></div> 

			<div class=" faq panel panel-info"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"> How would I cancel a pending payment by means of Paypal? </h4></div><div class="panel-body"> 

			<p>Assuming that an payment to a seller is still in the "Pending" status you may have the ability to cancel the payment. </p>

			<p>Login to Paypal, click the "Payments sent" connection, find the payment to the seller, click the Details bind, and there ought to be an alternative there to cross out the installment. </p></div></div> 

			<div class=" faq panel panel-info"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"> Can I change my shipping address after I've paid with Paypal? </h4></div><div class="panel-body"> 
<p>
			Paypal arrangement requires the seller ship to the address joined to the Paypal installment to be qualified for seller insurances. So Phonesalad can just suggest the seller ship to that address. </p>

			<p>Paypal does not permit the address to changed (or confirmed) after an installment is sent. So if the address you gave around then of installment is off base (or not confirmed) you will re-submit installment to the seller to make changes. Sorry, this is Paypal strategy (not Phonesalad arrangement). Assuming that this is important, inform Phonesalad staff who can help furnish directions.</p> </div></div> 

			<div class=" faq panel panel-info"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"> How would I contact a seller? </h4></div><div class="panel-body"> 

			To contact a seller simply leave a remark on the listing page. The seller will be messaged and react by means of comments. </div></div>


			<div class="faq panel panel-info"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"> What happens if a telephone sold on Phonesalad is blocked a month or two after sold? </h4></div><div class="panel-body"> 

		<p>	We do what we can to guarantee devices listed on the site are prepared for initiation when sold. What's more Paypal and your Visa have approaches for securing your cash assuming that you are protected, so you are ensured assuming that you are sold a blocked device or when it gets blocked inside their insurance window. </p>

			<p>Shouldn't we think about after the insurance windows, a couple of months in the future? The short answer is we can't avert this. Nor can ebay or craigslist or any possible site or administration. This situation where a device could be blocked a couple of months in the future, if permitted, is a defect in carrier strategies. </p>

			<p>So Phonesalad, Paypal, and your charge card organization are all attempting to help secure you, however that doesn't essentially anticipate all cheating situations later on.</p> </div></div> 

			<div class= "faq panel panel-info"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"> What are my payments choices when purchasing? </h4></div><div class="panel-body">
